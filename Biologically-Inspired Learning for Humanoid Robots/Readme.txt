This is the code for Biologically Inspired Learning for Humanoid Robots.

It is teamwork of Adon Yazigi, Shengzhi Wang,Fan Wu and Helene Obert.

Tutorial2 is the basic motion position control of NAO robot.

Tutorial3 to implement a feed forward neural network for learning a mapping between spatial visual and motor patterns. The mapping between visual and motor patterns enables the robot to perform a simple reaching task. The demo is also attached.

Tutorial4 is to implement a mixed density network (MDN) for learning a mapping between spatial visual and motor patterns. The mapping between visual and motor patterns enables the robot to perform a simple reaching task. The demo is also attached.

Tutorial5 is to apply a reinforcement learning method to penalty kicks in robot soccer games.

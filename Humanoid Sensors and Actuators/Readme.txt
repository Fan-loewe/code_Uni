This is the code for Humanoid Sensors and Actuators.

The private project is done by Fan Wu.
It is about Sound-source localization with head movement. Demo is also attached.


6 Tutorials are teamwork of Adon Yazigi, Shengzhi Wang,Fan Wu and Helene Obert.
Tutorial1 is about:
• How to program the AVR ATmega32 MCU
• How to use the general IO pins
• How to use the UART
• How to write assembler programs

Tutorial2 is about:
• How to use the ADC
• How to create and simulate circuits in LTSpice
• How to simulate and calculate filter circuits
• How to use Operation Amplifier circuits
• How to design and use a Wheatstone Bridge

Tutorial3 is about:
• How to use the AVR timers and Interrupts
• How to generate Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals
• How to use PWM to control a DC motor
• How to use PWM to control servo actuators
• How to build a software Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC)

Tutorial4 is about:
• How to operate a Brushless DC motor in Stepper mode 
• How to operate a Brushless DC motor in two quadrants 
• How to control the speed of a Brushless DC motor

Tutorial5 is about:
Signal Processing, including correlation, FFT and filtering. All tasks are under Matlab.

Tutorial6 is about:
